Welcome to my Github! My name is Jurian Sapoetra. I am from the Netherlands and I am studying to become a front-end developer. While working in the field of marketing and communication for many years, I built several websites and web shops with CMS such as WordPress. Through the years my interest in front-end development started growing and this year I finally decided to take action. Currently I am following an intensive front-end development course at Winc Academy. I expect to finish in October and then I will directly be available for a new challenge. The curriculum is focused on JavaScript, React, HTML5, CSS, Jest & Redux, working in an Agile Scrum environment and more. I am very enthusiastic about the new skill set that I am developing and looking forward to start a new job as a front-end developer as soon as possible.
